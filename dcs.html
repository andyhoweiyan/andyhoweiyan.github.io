                <h2>About Computer Science</h2>
                <p>The study of computer hardware and software design, development, and implementation is known as computer science. Programming languages, algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, software engineering, and database systems are some of the theoretical and practical areas included.
                    Applications that computer scientists work on range from creating new software and systems to analysing data and creating artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. They also work to enhance the functionality and safety of current computer networks and systems.
                    Mathematics, engineering, and other sciences are all used in the interdisciplinary area of computer science. It has a wide range of uses in fields like gaming, social networking, and education as well as in sectors like healthcare, banking, and transportation.</p>
                <h2>Programme Overview</h2>    
                <p>A computer science graduate will typically pursue occupations that involve little direct user engagement, such as designing and developing software, application technologies, or system infrastructure, such as web browsers or databases.
                    The program's goal is to give graduates the knowledge, fundamentals, and inventive problem-solving abilities necessary to advance the area of computer science.
                    The curriculum offers a thorough grounding in computer science, enabling you to learn the technical skills necessary to create cutting-edge software or computing solutions. 
                    You will also have the chance to do a variety of tasks while you are studying, including modelling, creating, developing, and assessing computing systems. 
                    Moreover, electives in specialised fields like computer security and computer vision are available. </p>
                            <h2>Specific Requirement</h2>
                            <p>Credit in Additional Mathematics at SPM or its equivalent
                                Graduates from Foundation/Matriculation programmes without a credit in Additional Mathematics subject at SPM level to enrol and Pass a Mathematics Enhancement subject offered by the programme; and credit in Mathematics and one subject from either Science, Technology or Engineering discipline at SPM level.</p>
                                
                                <p>The International Preparatory Programme (IPP) is an intensive six-month preparatory programme. International students or candidates from certain countries that want to take Harvord University’s certain degree programmes, they will need to take and pass our online six-month International Preparatory Programme (IPP) to be eligible to enrol on a Harvord degree programme that also leads to a degree certificate awarded by Harvord’s partner institution.
                                    Students are required to pass all the subjects with C and above to qualify for this.</p>
